# Some ground rules:

## - Self-contained module

### - everything to do with my module is in my module

### - no global variables

### - if a module manages more than one thing it should be split up

## - Seperation of concerns

## - DRY code: Don't Repeat Yourself

## - Efficient DOM usage

### - very few $(selections)

## - no memory leaks

### - all events can be unbound
