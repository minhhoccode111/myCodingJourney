# Introdution

- Separate from the module pattern that we discussed in an earlier lesson, "modules" is a feature that arrived with ES6. ES6 modules are starting to appear in many code bases around the net and getting them up and running will give us a chance to explore some new parts of the JavaScript ecosystem, so it's going to be a worthy excursion!
- Don't be fooled! We're going to cover much more than just new module syntax in this lesson! Before we can really use these modules, we're going to have to learn about npm and webpack, which are both topics that will be very useful to you even beyond this lesson. In the end, the modules themselves are simple to implement, so we're going to take this chance to learn about a few other things.
